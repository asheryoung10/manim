# What is Manim?
Manim is a free, open source, python animation library that was originally created by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/). 
This repository contains the source code for any animations (just one for now) that I have made using the tool. I use [Manim Community](https://www.manim.community/).
